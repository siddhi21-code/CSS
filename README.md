Type of css

*CSS Definition:*

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages, separating presentation from structure.

*Types of CSS:*

1. *Internal CSS*: CSS code is written directly in the HTML file using the `<style>` tag.
2. *External CSS*: CSS code is written in a separate file with a `.css` extension and linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
3. *Inline CSS*: CSS code is written directly in the HTML element using the `style` attribute.

These three types of CSS allow developers to apply styles to web pages in different ways, depending on the project's requirements and complexity.
